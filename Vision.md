# ATLP Vision

The AI Trust & Licensing Protocol (ATLP) envisions a future where:
- AI is safe  
- creators are protected  
- trust is measurable  
- authorship is provable  
- autonomy is allowed but accountable  

We believe the future of AI will not be defined only by model size or capabilities,
but by **trust, transparency, and verifiable responsibility**.

ATLP aims to set the foundation for:
- safe autonomous AI agents  
- cross-platform interoperability  
- global trust scoring  
- accountability frameworks  
- strong developer rights  
- integrity of AI-generated content  

This public documentation is the beginning of a broader mission:
to create a unified, global trust and licensing standard for AI.

The world is ready for the next layer of AI —  
ATLP is that layer.
