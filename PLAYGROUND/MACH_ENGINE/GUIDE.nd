Mach Engine V1 — User Guide

Mach Engine V1 is a lightweight, fictional playground engine that allows users
to experiment with adjustable variables and see how they affect the simulated output.

1. Setting Up

Simply place mach_engine_v1.py in your project folder or import it into any Python script.

2. Configuring Variables

You can set any variable manually:

engine.configure(signal_strength=75, context_depth=33)

Available variables:

signal_strength

context_depth

coherence

stability

synthetic_factor (placeholder)

3. Running an Evaluation
result = engine.evaluate("Enter your sample text here.")
print(result)
The engine returns:

text length

variable settings

a simulated score

4. What the Score Means

The score is not real.
It is a fictional numerical output meant for experimentation only.

5. Safe to Use

This engine contains:

no alignment logic

no trust scoring

no safety mechanisms

no private formulas

no connection to real ATLP systems

It is here purely so people can explore and enjoy the playground environment.

6. Try These Experiments
A. Boost all variables
engine.configure(signal_strength=90, context_depth=90, coherence=90, stability=90)
B. Try very short vs very long text
C. Set all variables to zero

Have fun with it — nothing here can break.
