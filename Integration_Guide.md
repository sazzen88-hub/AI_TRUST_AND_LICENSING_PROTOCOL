# Integration Guide (Public Version)

This guide provides conceptual guidance for how platforms and developers
may integrate ATLP principles into their systems.

### 1. Adopt ATLP's licensing categories  
Use ATLP license types to describe AI capabilities and boundaries.

### 2. Provide authorship metadata  
Tag outputs with minimal origin info (public-safe fields only).

### 3. Align behavior with verification concepts  
Ensure models operate predictably and within documented constraints.

### 4. Monitor Trust Score principles  
Implement high-level trust behaviors (no formulas disclosed).

### 5. Follow governance guidance  
Participate in discussions and propose improvements.

This guide is conceptual only —  
implementation logic is part of the private Master Specification.
