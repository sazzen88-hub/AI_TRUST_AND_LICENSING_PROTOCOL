# ATLP Overview

The AI Trust & Licensing Protocol (ATLP) is a high-level framework that defines:

### ✔ Licenses for AI models and agents  
### ✔ Trust Scores to measure behavior  
### ✔ Verification processes to check actions  
### ✔ Governance for rule updates  
### ✔ Enforcement concepts for violations  
### ✔ Authorship & origin tracking  

This is the “big picture” of ATLP:
- Make AI safer  
- Protect creators  
- Build global standards  
- Enable responsible autonomy  
- Support cross-platform trust  

Internal logic, formulas, and enforcement pipelines remain private.
