# Support Guide — AI Trust & Licensing Protocol (ATLP)

Thank you for your interest in the AI Trust & Licensing Protocol (ATLP).  
This document explains how to get help, ask questions, and participate in public discussions.

## 📘 Where to Get Help

### 1. **GitHub Issues**
Use the **Issues** tab for:
- Questions about public documentation  
- Requests for clarification  
- Reporting unclear or missing explanations  
- Suggesting public-safe improvements  

**Do NOT** include any internal logic, trust formulas, enforcement rules, or sensitive information.

---

### 2. **Proposals (Conceptual Only)**
If you want to propose:
- improvements  
- conceptual additions  
- new public examples  
- terminology updates  
- documentation enhancements  

Open an Issue describing your idea.

## 🔐 What NOT to Request Support For

ATLP’s private Master Specification includes sensitive systems such as:
- trust-score algorithms  
- enforcement logic  
- verification rule-sets  
- evidence structures  
- cryptographic authorship mechanisms  
- governance authority logic  

**Support cannot be provided for these components.**  
They are not part of the public repo and cannot be shared or discussed.

## 🛡 Security or Safety Concerns

If you believe you’ve found:
- a documentation inconsistency  
- a conceptual safety issue  
- unclear governance text  

Open an Issue with a clear explanation.

For anything sensitive:  
**Do not post publicly.**  
Instead, request guidance and wait for a maintainer response.
